To whom it may concern,

This project was created as an application for an internship. The internship was about creating a Portfoliomanagement software. Therefore, I voluntarily created this
Python script. It proposes an individual portfolio for an investment beginner, based on a few parameters, considering their investment preferences. 

As a result, the user receives a pdf document, containing stocks and ETFs as well as their weights in the portfolio and some data about the performance.
It took about 7 days to finish the project--most of the invested time went into the research about the carefully selected stocks. I also shortly analysed 
each one of the included 65 stocks from 2015 to 2019 and researched their return per year manually.

To use the script, you have to install the requirements from the requirements.txt file, using the pip install r- requirements.txt function.
Following you simply execute the MyGui.py script and let the script run. After pressing the generate button, you can find the pdf document in the same 
directory as the MyGui file. The pdf document will be updated once you press the generate button again with other preferences.


The intention of this project, was to demonstrate that I have basic Python skills as well as the ability to create solutions to problems that may pop up.
Throughout coding this script, I have learned a lot of new things. 
For example, I never coded a GUI, beacuse I have mainly done backend coding.

Thank you for taking your time.

Best regards,
